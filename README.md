1. LAUNCH THE APPLICATION:
- create a .xmind file 
	- !!! the result is much better if the figures have a transparent background
	- !!! LaTeX natively cannot handle list with a 4-level (or more) depth
	- !!! empty topic or subtopic give empty slide...
- Header.tex
	- change the author and the institute names
	- change the main color
- need boost library
- you can use the .bat file
	- have to change the path of the different programs
- else you have to:
	- copy the .xmind file in a .zip file 
	- uncompress it inside a folder which name is the one of .xmind file
	- compile the .cpp (which need boost)
	- launch the application: Xmind2Beamer $NAME_OF_FOLDER $FUSE_MODE
	- compile the Temp.tex (that have to be inside the folder)
	- save the .pdf file elsewhere
	- erase the tempory folder

	
2. HOW IT WORKS:
- there is an example with a .xmind file with its corresponding .pdf file
	- all the features are presented in this example

- more details on this program:
- presentation title == principal subject title  (one principal subject is taken into account)
- for each topics of the principal subject (ie 1. and 2.)
	- if the section is named $m_keywordAppendix 
		- add the "last-slide" slide
		- add the separator \appendix to "hide" the supplementary slides
		- the children of this section are not visited (see this section as a separator)
		- the following sections/subsections will appear on a different ToC
		- a new frame number is used for the appendix section
	- create a section
	- check if we can create a subsection 
		- ALL the children (ie A. B.) must have children (ie a. b.) 
		- ALL these children (ie a. b.) must have children too
		- create a subsection 
	- for each topic of the section or subsection 
		- if there is an image
			- if the slide don't have child
				- add a new child with the image
			- else add the image to each children
		- check the size of elements (ie text and figure)
			- we use several values related to the font size:
				- we consider 5 sorts of font size: title, block, 1st-depth item, 2nd-depth item, 3rd-depth item
				- we consider for each sort 4 values:
					- the font width: average value of a char
					- the line width: the maximum char that can be put on a line
					- the line height: the height of one line
					- the line space: additionnal space
				- and we have the available space which is the slide height
				- for each text (title/block/item) we add its contribution to compute the size of the element
				- for each figure: 
					- we change the width and height but we keep the aspect ratio
					- we first check if the figure width is within the block width
					- after we adapt the height according to the remaining available space [RAS]
						- if the figure height is lesser or equal to RAS, don't change its height
						- else we try to reduce the figure according to RAS and a parameter 
							- this parameter $m_thresholdFigure -> how much we can reduce the height 
								- for example, 0.4 -> 40% of the height
							- if it is not enough, we change the height to fit the next slide
			- if too much elements (according to the available space), the slide is cut
				- check the children of the slide to know where to cut between the elements of the slide
				- if it's not possible, cut between subelements (but it can be ugly)
			- else, check the next slide and if the sum is less than the available space, fuse both slides together
				- !!! not sure it's a good idea (sometime two very different topics can be on the same slide)
				- thus we add three modes (second parameter of the executable, have to change in the .bat file):
					- no fuse at all 
					- fuse slides but not the ones that have been cut
					- fuse all slides (can fuse the last slide obtained after a cut only)
		- for each slide
			- create a new frame which title == title of the topic
			- create a new box
			- add recursively each children as an item (itemize)
				- !!! LaTeX natively cannot handle list with a 4-level (or more) depth 
				- can use enumitem package but:
					- we lose the magic [<+->] option...
					- more than 3-depth list on one slide seems crappy so we don't allow that
			- if we have to fuse add a new block and add elements etc
			- if we have to cut 
				- add a (1/X (ie the number of subslides)) in the box title
				- create a frame + box for each subslide

- add element:
	- text is formatted to manage the special characters LaTeX restrictions 
	- text take the style defined in the styles.xml file into account
		- the font size (!!! not sure if it's a good idea)
		- the color
		- bold
		- italic 
	- figure (height=0.5\\baselineskip) 
		- try to have a transparent background else it's ugly inside the colored box
	- website link which text will be the title of the topic
	- element markers (the first one only) will be put in the LaTeX file as the tick of the corresponding item
		- the marker figures are normally provided with this application
		- else you have to find it yourself (search for other-question.png for example)
	- outline is remind for each section
	
- LaTeX style (mainly inside the Header.tex file):
	- the alignement of slide elements is put to top [t]
		- the result is better when you have cut a slide:
			- each subslide will have its box title at the same place
		- good to have to look at the same place 
	- use theme Madrid  
		- don't like the outline-on-each-slide
	- remove some space between figure and text (below and above)
	- keep some navigation buttons and add one to go directly on the first outline slide
	- color definitions
	- footline definition
		- on the left, you can add figures of your institues
		- on the right,we add the current slide / the total number of slides
	- what we do for each section
		- we add an outline in two columns with:
			- the current section in normal font
			- the other sections are shaded
			- all the subsections are hidden
	- what we do for each subsection
		- we add an outline in one column with:
			- the current section and subsection in normal font
			- the other sections are hidden
			- the other subsections are shaded
